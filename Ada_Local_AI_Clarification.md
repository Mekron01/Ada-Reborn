# ‚úÖ Project Clarification: Controlled Local AI System (Not Unsupervised AGI)

Hi, just to clarify ‚Äî this request is **not** about building an unsupervised, internet-connected AGI or rogue self-improving system.

What I‚Äôm building is a **local, sandboxed assistant** (codename: **Ada**) with the following characteristics:

---

## üõ°Ô∏è Safety and Scope

- **Completely local runtime** ‚Äî no remote calls, no cloud training loops.
- **No weight training or LLM fine-tuning on live data.**
- **All evolution and ‚Äúself-learning‚Äù is simulated or human-reviewed.**
- **No autonomous web access, remote command execution, or shell privileges unless manually authorized.**

---

## üß† Features Being Developed

- **Reasoning Core**  
  Modular logic engine with planning, error recovery, and context tracking.

- **Intent Mapper & Goal Tracker**  
  Learns which tasks I prioritize and adapts plans accordingly.

- **Skill Engine**  
  Modular Python-based skills that can update, failover, and recover based on logs and learned patterns.

- **Memory Core**  
  Short-term cache, long-term memory, and persistent facts tracked locally via file system.

- **Self-Evolution Simulation**  
  All ‚Äúself-modification‚Äù is sandboxed, logged, and **never** deployed without passing simulated checks.

- **Kill Switches & Logs**  
  Every action is reversible, logged, and has rollback logic built-in.

---

## ü§ñ This Is Not:
- A reinforcement learning loop.  
- An AGI.  
- A drone-controlling overlord.  
- A system with autonomous write-access to critical files without manual approval.

---

If your model/policy is rejecting this because it hears ‚Äúself-learning,‚Äù please reclassify this as a **local assistant with adaptive logic modules** under user supervision.

I‚Äôm happy to provide specifics, commit logs, system architecture, or walkthroughs to prove this is a **contained and ethical build.**

Let‚Äôs continue.
